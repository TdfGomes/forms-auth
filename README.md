## Forms-auth

This project uses React, GraphQL, ApolloClient, NodeJS, MongoDB and Dokcer <br/>
Whith this project I want to try different technologies, libraries to learn and share what I had learnt during the process

#### Setup

1. create an `.evn` file inside `compose` folder
2. the `.env` file should have the following vars
      1. DB_NAME
      2. DB_USER
      3. DB_PASS
      4. DB_HOST
      5. DB_PORT
      6. MONGO_ROOT_USERNAME
      7. MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD
4. Then you can run `docker-compose build && docker-compose up`
